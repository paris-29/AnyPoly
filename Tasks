Week 2: Rust Core Concepts

    Study ownership, borrowing, lifetimes

    Learn structs, enums, pattern matching

    Understand traits and generics

    Complete Rustlings exercises 16-40

    Build: Simple todo list with file I/O

Week 3: First Interpreter Steps

    Read Crafting Interpreters Chapters 1-4

    Build: Arithmetic expression evaluator (no variables)

    Implement: Lexer (tokenizer) for simple math

    Implement: Parser (recursive descent) for AST

    Implement: Interpreter that walks AST

    Add: REPL for your expression calculator

Week 4: Language Features & Project Setup

    Extend interpreter with variables

    Add: Print statements

    Add: Support for multi-expression programs

    Set up: Git repository for polyglot project

    Organize: Project structure (parser, interpreter modules)

    Test: Your simple language with sample programs

    Document: Your language's grammar and usage

Weekly Checkpoints:

Week 1 Done: Can write basic Rust programs
Week 2 Done: Understand memory safety concepts
Week 3 Done: Have working expression calculator
Week 4 Done: Have working "toy language" with variables
Daily Time Commitment:

    Weekdays: 2 hours/day (coding + learning)

    Weekends: 4 hours/day (project work)

    Total: ~18 hours/week

Success Criteria for Month 1:

    Can compile and run Rust programs

    Understand ownership/borrowing

    Have working simple language interpreter

    Can parse and evaluate: let x = 5 + 3; print x;

Start small. Complete each bracket. Don't skip ahead.
Focus on understanding, not just completion.
